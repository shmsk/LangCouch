 * Build the weave instruction injected into the agent's context.
 * English-only surface (user rule: no Russian in instructions); glosses come from
 * the concept gloss record, keyed by config.native (en fallback).
 * Hard budget: ≤2400 chars (~600 tokens) — verified by test.
 *
 * Algorithm 1 asks for every listed word. Algorithm 2 asks for a word only where
 * the reply already needs its meaning: the 2026-09-30 eval (evals/results/) showed
 * that asking for all of them makes every model invent sentences to host words.
 * Algorithm 3 is algorithm 2 plus a nudge (1-2 long-overdue words allowed as an
 * aside or a closing line) and translations that fade with the ladder step:
 * inline, then only in a closing glossary line, then none (`known`).
 *
 * A numeral among the picks (at most one) is woven next to its digit, 3 (**tre**), so the
 * fact stays readable. `num` is a number rule; it takes the word-building rule's slot.
 *
 * `reading` gives a word's pronunciation as the learner should see it ("" for none); words
 * that carry their translation inline carry it too, **word** [reading] (translation).
