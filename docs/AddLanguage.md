# Adding a language to Lazy Polyglot

This document is written for an AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) — a human can follow it too. Following it end-to-end produces a complete, validated language, either just for yourself or as a PR for everyone.

## What you are building

Lazy Polyglot weaves target-language words into an AI agent's replies. Vocabulary is defined once as a canonical inventory of ~400 language-independent meanings (`data/concepts.json`); each language is a thin file mapping concept ids to that language's words. You will produce **one JSON file**. Three more are optional: grammar constructions, word-building rules and false friends. No code changes: the language name is derived from its ISO code.

Inputs you need before starting:
- the ISO 639-1 language code (`tr`, `de`, `fr`, …) — called `<code>` below

## Two ways to add a language

- **For yourself** (Claude Code plugin users): run `/lazy-polyglot:add-language <language>`, or follow this doc and put the file at `~/.lazy-polyglot/wordlists/<code>.json` (optional files go next to it: `~/.lazy-polyglot/grammar/`, `~/.lazy-polyglot/patterns/`, `~/.lazy-polyglot/falseFriends/`, each as `<code>.json`). It lives next to your progress and survives plugin updates. No clone needed; validate with `lazy-polyglot validate <code> --full` (inside Claude Code: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cli.sh validate <code> --full`). Never write into the plugin folder (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/…`): it is replaced on every update.
- **For everyone** (a PR): work in a clone of this repo with [bun](https://bun.sh) (`bun install`), put the file at `data/wordlists/<code>.json`, and follow every step below including the PR checklist.

A file in `~/.lazy-polyglot/wordlists/` overrides a bundled one with the same code, so you can also fix a word locally.

## Step 1 — Read the concept inventory

Open `data/concepts.json`. Each entry is:

```json
{ "id": "house", "pos": "noun", "tier": 1, "gloss": { "en": "house", "ru": "дом" } }
```

- `id` — stable kebab-case concept id; this is what your file keys on
- `pos` — part of speech the translation must match (`noun` | `verb` | `adj` | `adv`)
- `gloss.en` — the English meaning; where an id carries a sense hint (`time-occasion`, `floor-surface`), translate that specific sense
- `tier` — vocabulary band (all current concepts are tier 1); ignore it when translating

A complete contribution covers **every** concept.

## Step 2 — Create `<code>.json`

A flat JSON object, one line per entry, concept id → word:

```json
{
 "house": "ev",
 "time": "zaman"
}
```

Translation rules (the validator enforces the mechanical ones):

1. **Most common everyday word** for the concept, matching its `pos`. No rare, literary, or archaic words — pick what a beginner hears daily.
2. **Lemma / citation form**: nouns in singular, verbs in the language's dictionary form (infinitive where that is the convention), adjectives in the base (masculine singular where applicable).
3. **Single word strongly preferred**; hard maximum 3 space-separated tokens.
4. **The natural word wins, even when two concepts share it.** If your language really uses one everyday word for two concepts (Spanish *mañana* = morning and tomorrow, Turkish *ay* = moon and month), use it for both; don't swap in a rare synonym to keep them apart. Lazy Polyglot handles it: a batch shows the word once, a recall credits both concepts, and the quiz accepts either meaning. At most 2 concepts may share a word (the validator enforces it), and it prints every shared word, so **list them in your PR** for the auditor to confirm each is real.
5. **Keep noun and verb apart by citation form where the language has one.** English writes verbs as `to work`, `to love`, so the verb entry never reads like the noun; the weave inflects it in context anyway (*worked*, *she loves*). Where the language has no such form, rule 4 applies.
6. **Content words only.** If the natural translation is a particle or function word, choose the nearest content-word synonym. When your language expresses a concept grammatically rather than lexically (no verb "to have", modality as a suffix, comparatives needing a particle), use the closest common periphrastic or derived form — that is expected, not a violation; note it in the PR.
7. Native script, lowercase by the language's own convention (this matters for recall matching — e.g. Turkish dotted/dotless i). Where correct orthography and what users actually type diverge, **the typed form wins**.
8. No transliterations of English, no offensive words. Words shorter than 3 characters are fine when they're the natural choice — they just never trigger prompt-recall (see FAQ); mention roughly how many such entries you have in the PR.

## Step 3 — Language name: nothing to register

The instruction names the language via `Intl.DisplayNames` (`ka` → Georgian). Use a standard ISO 639-1 code and it just works; there is no code to edit.

## Step 4 (optional) — `data/grammar/<code>.json`

Grammar constructions unlock at higher levels. Mirror the schema of `data/grammar/es.json`:

```json
{ "id": "def-article", "pattern": "gender + definite article (el/la + noun)", "exampleTarget": "la casa", "exampleGloss": "the house", "unlock": { "pos": "noun", "absorbedCount": 3 } }
```

8–12 constructions, ordered easy → hard with rising `absorbedCount` thresholds (compare `data/grammar/es.json`). `pattern` and `exampleGloss` are in English; `exampleTarget` must use words from your wordlist. Skip this step if unsure — languages work without a grammar file.

## Step 4b (optional) — `data/patterns/<code>.json` and `data/falseFriends/<code>.json`

Word-building rules teach one suffix that turns a whole family of known words into your language: *-tion → -ción* makes *revolución*, *información*, *nación* readable at once. One rule per reply, from level 2. Mirror `data/patterns/es.json`:

```json
{ "id": "tion", "from": { "en": "-tion", "ru": "-ция" }, "to": "-ción", "examples": [ { "target": "revolución", "gloss": { "en": "revolution", "ru": "революция" } } ], "source": "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ci%C3%B3n" }
```

- `id`: reuse the ids other languages use (`tion`, `ity`, `al`, `ism`, `ist`, `ic`, `ly`, `ate`, `irovat`, `izovat`), so a learner's rules line up across languages.
- `from`: the suffix in each native language that has a real parallel. Leave a key out when it has none (`ly` has no `ru`); the learner then sees the English side, or nothing for a ru-only rule.
- `examples`: exactly 3 common words with the same meaning in every native language, and each gloss should itself show the native suffix (*revolución = революция*).
- `source`: a URL that backs the correspondence, usually the Wiktionary page of the suffix.
- 5–8 rules, most reliable first; the file order is the teaching order. Drop a rule whose exceptions outnumber its matches.

False friends warn about words that look like a rule but mean something else. Mirror `data/falseFriends/es.json`:

```json
{ "target": "actual", "means": { "en": "current", "ru": "текущий", "uz": "joriy" }, "register": "neutral", "looksLike": { "en": "actual" }, "pattern": "al", "source": "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/actual" }
```

`means` gives the real meaning in every native language (`en`, `ru`, `uz`); the learner sees theirs, falling back to English. A plain string still loads, but then every learner sees that one language. `pattern` ties it to a rule; only false friends with a `pattern` are shown, next to that rule. A word that is rude somewhere gets `"register": "vulgar"` and `"vulgarIn": ["<code>"]` for the codes where it is rude. Such words are never taught; the tests fail if one is a lemma or an example in those codes, and the instruction tells the agent to avoid it. Never put a vulgar word in `examples`.

Check every example and false friend against a live dictionary, then run the Step 6 audit on these files too.

## Step 4c — numbers: the 30 numerals and `data/numbers/<code>.json`

Numbers are taught as building blocks plus rules. The wordlist maps the 30 numeral concepts (`num-0` … `num-20`, `num-30` … `num-90`, `num-100`, `num-1000`) to the standalone counting form ("uno", "cien", "mil"); `--full` validation fails without them. Put them early in the wordlist (after the first ~40 entries): the file order is the order new words come in. A reply carries at most one numeral, woven next to its digit: `3 (**tre**)`.

`data/numbers/<code>.json` holds 4–8 rules, in teaching order, that let a learner build any number up to 1000 from those blocks:

```json
{ "id": "teens", "hint": { "en": "17-19: dicia-/dician- + unit, one word", "ru": "17-19: dicia-/dician- + единица, одним словом", "uz": "17-19: dicia-/dician- + birlik, bitta so'z" }, "example": { "value": 17, "target": "diciassette" }, "source": "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/diciassette" }
```

- `hint`: what to memorize and what follows a pattern, in every native language, at most 110 characters each.
- `example`: one number the rule builds, spelled correctly; up to 1000, except a thousands rule may show 2000 to make its point (*dos mil*).
- A regional variant may override a base rule with a file of its own, using the same `id`.

A rule is shown when a numeral is in the reply and some rule is still new (shown fewer than 3 times); it then takes the word-building rule's place.

## Step 4d (optional) — `data/readings/<code>.json`

Only for a language that is not read the way it is spelled (French, English, Portuguese are; Spanish, Italian, Turkish are not). New words then come with their pronunciation, rendered for each learner in their own letters or as IPA (`/lazy-polyglot:reading`). The file maps every concept id to its IPA:

```json
{
 "house": "mɛ.zɔ̃",
 "time": "tɑ̃"
}
```

- The phonemic transcription from the language section of the word's English Wiktionary page, without the slashes: syllable dots and the stress mark `ˈ` stay (the English respelling capitalises the stressed syllable, the Russian one marks it).
- The standard citation form: not a weak form, a dialect, a liaison form or a usage note. Where Wiktionary lists several standard accents, use the one your base code stands for (`en`: General American, `pt`: Portugal).
- Cover every concept in your wordlist; `bun test` checks coverage and renders every entry for every native language, failing on any IPA symbol it cannot spell.
- A regional variant gets its own file with only the words that sound different, plus every word it spells differently (`pt-BR`: Brazilian pronunciation; `en-GB`: Received Pronunciation).
- For yourself, the file goes in `~/.lazy-polyglot/readings/<code>.json`, like the others.

## Step 5 — Validate

All three must pass; paste their output into your PR description:

```bash
bun tests/validate-wordlist.ts <code> --full   # every concept covered, shared words listed (for yourself: lazy-polyglot validate <code> --full)
bunx tsc --noEmit                              # typecheck
bun test                                       # unit tests
```

If `tsc` or `bun test` fail in files you never touched, that's a pre-existing repo issue, not yours: verify your two files aren't in the error output, report it in the PR, and continue — the wordlist validator passing is your gate.

## Step 6 — Second-model quality audit (strongly recommended)

Have a **different model or vendor** than the one that generated the list review it read-only. Prompt template:

> You are auditing a beginner-frequency wordlist for {Language} learners. Below are entries `conceptId: word`, each with the concept's English gloss and part of speech. Flag any entry that is: (a) a wrong translation for the glossed sense, (b) wrong part of speech, (c) a rare/unnatural choice where a more common everyday word exists, or (d) not the lemma/citation form. Output ONLY a list of `conceptId: current → suggested (one-line reason)`. Do not rewrite the file, do not comment on correct entries.

Apply the fixes you agree with, re-run Step 5, and note in the PR which findings you applied or rejected and why. (Precedent: the Portuguese list went through such an audit; 19 of 24 findings were applied.)

## Step 7 — Live smoke test

```bash
export LAZY_POLYGLOT_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
bun src/cli.ts init
bun src/cli.ts lang <code>
bun src/cli.ts instruction
```

Expect a `<lazy-polyglot>` block containing `word = gloss` pairs in your language. (The inflection example inside the block — "casas, bonitas" — is currently fixed Spanish wording regardless of language; that's expected.) Unset `LAZY_POLYGLOT_DIR` afterwards.

## Step 8 — PR checklist

- [ ] Files touched are exactly: `data/wordlists/<code>.json` and optionally `data/grammar/<code>.json`, `data/patterns/<code>.json`, `data/falseFriends/<code>.json`, `data/numbers/<code>.json`, `data/readings/<code>.json`
- [ ] Output of all three Step 5 commands pasted
- [ ] Audit summary: model used, findings applied/rejected
- [ ] Live smoke test output pasted
- [ ] Listed: shared words (rule 4), periphrastic forms (rule 6), count of <3-char recall-dead entries (rule 8)

## Adding a regional variant (pt-BR, pt-PT, es-MX, …)

Some learners want one regional standard specifically: Brazilian Portuguese says *trem* and *celular*, European Portuguese says *comboio* and *telemóvel*. A variant is **not** a full copy of the language. It is a small file holding only the words that differ from the base language; every other concept comes from the base.

- **Code**: BCP 47, `<base>-<REGION>` (`pt-BR`, `es-MX`, `es-419`). Case doesn't matter on the command line (`lang pt-br` works); the file name uses the canonical form, `pt-BR.json`. The name comes from `Intl.DisplayNames` ("Brazilian Portuguese"), nothing to register.
- **File**: `~/.lazy-polyglot/wordlists/pt-BR.json` for yourself, `data/wordlists/pt-BR.json` for a PR. The base (`pt`) must exist, bundled or local.
- **Content**: go through the base wordlist and add an entry only where the variant's everyday word differs. Rules 1–8 above apply to each entry. Don't copy a base word into the variant: the validator rejects entries identical to the base.
- **Grammar**: optional `data/grammar/pt-BR.json`, an overlay on the base's grammar. An item with a base `id` replaces that item, a new `id` is added. Give a regional item `baseExample` (the base's way of saying it), and it is taught first with a contrast: *ustedes trabajan (Spain: vosotros trabajáis)*. See `data/grammar/es-419.json`.
- **Word-building rules**: a variant uses its base's `data/patterns/` file; add `data/patterns/<code>.json` only for rules that differ.
- **Rude words**: if a base word is rude in the variant's region, add it to the base's `data/falseFriends/<base>.json` with `"vulgarIn": ["<code>"]`. The contrast then warns about it (*Spain: coger (vulgar in much of Latin America)*), and the tests fail if the variant ever teaches it.
- **Validate**: `lazy-polyglot validate pt-BR --full` (repo: `bun tests/validate-wordlist.ts pt-BR --full`). Duplicates and coverage are checked on the merged result, so a variant word that clashes with another base word is caught.
- **Audit**: run Step 6 on the variant entries plus the base entries you considered and kept. The question for the auditor is "is this what a speaker of that region says every day?"
- **Progress** is shared with the base for every word spelled the same, and for shared grammar and rules. Switching from `pt` to `pt-BR` keeps all of it; only the variant's own words and constructions start fresh, and they come first.

## Also possible: adding native-language glosses

Learners see translations in their own language via `config.native`. To support a new *native* language, add a `"<code>": "…"` key to the `gloss` object of every concept in `data/concepts.json` (keep `en` and existing keys). The same quality rules and audit flow apply; validate with `bun tests/validate-wordlist.ts`.

## FAQ / known limitations

- **Why at most 2 concepts per word?** Progress is kept per concept, but a recall of a shared word credits every concept that uses it. Two is a real homonym; more means the list is dodging the work.
- **Multi-token entries** are never counted by the prompt-recall scanner (it matches single tokens only) — another reason to prefer single words.
- **Words shorter than 3 characters** are never counted as recalls (noise filter).
- **Case folding**: recall matching lowercases with default Unicode rules; store words pre-lowercased in your language's own convention (Turkish `İstanbul` → dotted lowercase `i̇stanbul` differs from `istanbul` — prefer the form users actually type).
